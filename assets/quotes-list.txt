--H.L. Mencken
Love, friendship, respect, admiration are the emotional response of one man to the virtues of another, the spiritual payment given in exchange for the personal, selfish pleasure which one man derives from the virtues of another man's character. Only a brute or an altruist would claim that the appreciation of another person's virtues is an act of selflessness, that as far as one's own selfish interest and pleasure are concerned, it makes no difference whether one deals with a genius or a fool, whether one meets a hero or a thug, whether one marries an ideal woman or a slut.
--Ayn Rand
Persecution is not an original feature in any religion; but it is always the strongly marked feature of all religions established by law.

--Ayn Rand
Volumes can be and have been written about the issue of    freedom versus dictatorship, but, in essence, it comes down to    a single question: do you consider it moral to treat men as    sacrificial animals and to rule them by physical force?
--Ayn Rand
To fear to face an issue is to believe the worst is    true.
--Ayn Rand
Let us beware that while Soviet rulers preach the supremacy of the state, declare its omnipotence over individual man, and predict its eventual domination over all the peoples of the earth, they are the focus of evil in the modern world.... I urge you to beware the temptation ... to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire, to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong, good and evil.
--Ronald Reagan
If an exchange between two parties is voluntary, it will    not take place unless both believe they will benefit from it.    Most economic fallacies derive from the neglect of this simple    insight, from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie,    that one party can gain only at the expense of another.
--Milton Friedman
Do not ever say that the desire to do good by force is a good motive. Neither power-lust nor stupidity are good motives.

I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.
--Robert A. Heinlein
Philosophy studies the fundamental nature of existence, of man, and of man's relationship to existence. ? In the realm of cognition, the special sciences are the trees, but philosophy is the soil which makes the forest possible.
--Ayn Rand
There is no squabbling so violent as between people who    accept an idea yesterday, and those who will accept the same    idea tomorrow.

Reason integrates man's perceptions by means of forming abstractions or conceptions, thus raising man's knowledge from the perceptual level , which he shares with animals, to the conceptual level, which he alone can reach. The method which reason employs in this process is logic -- and logic is the art of non-contradictory identification.
--Ayn Rand
The unphilosophical majority among men are the ones most helplessly dependent on their era's dominant ideas. In times of crises these men need the guidance of some kind of theory; but, being unfamiliar with the field of ideas, they do not know that alternatives to the popular theories are possible. They know only what they have always been taught.
--Leonard Peikoff

One can not be a traitor to anything, except to    oneself.

It is important to tell Kant that he has rejected reality and is wrong ; it is more important that Aristotle find someone who understands that he has recognized reality and is right.

The moral precept to adopt...is: Judge, and be prepared    to be judged.
--Ayn Rand
One's own independent judgment is the means by which one must choose one's actions, but it is not a moral criterion nor a moral validation; only reference to a demonstrable principle can validate one's choices.

Existence exists and the act of grasping that statement implies two corollary axioms: that something exists which one perceives and that one exists possessing consciousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceiving that which exists.
--Ayn Rand
It has often been said that power corrupts. But it is perhaps equally important to realize that weakness, too, corrupts. Power corrupts the few, while weakness corrupts the many. Hatred, malice, rudeness, intolerance, and suspicion are the faults of weakness. The resentment of the weak does not spring from any injustice done to them but from the sense of inadequacy and impotence. They hate not wickedness but weakness. When it is their power to do so, the weak destroy weakness wherever they see it.
--Eric Hoffer
Whoever claims that economic competition represents    'survival of the fittest' in the sense of the law of the    jungle, provides the clearest possible evidence of his lack of    knowledge of economics.

If you wish to prosper, let your customer prosper. When    people have learned this lesson, everyone will seek his    individual welfare in the general welfare. Then jealousies    between man and man, city and city, province and province,    nation and nation, will no longer trouble the world.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal." ... I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.
