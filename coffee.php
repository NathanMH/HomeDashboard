							<li>Heat the water: Bring your water to a boil then let it cool for about 1 minute. (You're aiming for something in between 175°F and 195°F.)</li>
							<li>Grind the beans: Measure out 12g - 20g of ground coffee (about 4 tablespoons).</li>
							<li>Wet the filter: Assemble the AeroPress with a paper filter inside the cap and place on top of a mug or cup. Drizzle a little warm water in to wet the filter.</li>
							<li>Add the coffee: Pour in the coffee.</li>
							<li>Add the water: Pour in coffee until it comes up to the top line on the AeroPress.</li>
							<li>Stir: Use the paddle stirrer (or a spoon) to stir once, briefly.</li>
							<li>Press: Insert the plunger. Firmly press down the plunger until you hear a long hiss.</li>
							<li>Taste and dilute: Taste the coffee and if desired add more water. The AeroPress makes a concentrated cup of coffee and if desired you can split this amount between two cups and add a little more hot water.</li>
							<li>Enjoy!</li>
						</ul>
						<ol class="col">
							<p>Inverted</p>
							<li>Assemble the AeroPress upside-down: Heat the water and grind the coffee as described above. Assemble the AeroPress by putting plunger in the chamber. Flip upside-down but don't put the cap or filter on.</li>
							<li>Pour in the coffee: Put the funnel in. Pour the ground coffee (from 2 AeroPress scoops of beans) into the the chamber.</li>
							<li>Pour in the water: Add hot water until the chamber is almost full.</li>
							<li>Stir</li>
							<li>Steep for 1 minute: Try steeping for 1 minute, but adjust in future batches if this comes out too strong or too weak.</li>
							<li>Put on the cap: Place a paper filter in the cap and screw tightly onto the chamber.</li>
							<li>Flip over, carefully! Quickly and carefully flip the full AeroPress over so the cap is down, and place on a mug or pitcher.</li>
							<li>Press</li>
							<li>Enjoy!</li>
